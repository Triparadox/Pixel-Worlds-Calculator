This project is currently under work. As of now, to use the product, you must run the files locally on your machine.
There is a plan to bring the website live and hosted once the project is in a ready state.

To use the calculator, you need to enter the amount of fish you have (size sensitive) into the appropriate column.
The columns are ordered HUGE, LARGE, MEDIUM, SMALL, TINY. You may leave the columns untouched for fish you do not have.

The total is displayed at the bottom of the screen. It updates live as you change each column (no need to press submit button).

More functionalities are expected to come. Gemstone calculator from mining may be the next major update.
